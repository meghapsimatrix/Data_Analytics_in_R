## R Projects and Relative Path

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![](images/R_project.png)
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
-   Keep all materials related to a project (or a class) together in one place

-   The working directory is set to the base folder

-   You can set relative paths so other users are able to run code without messing too much with the working directory

-   Read more about how to set up projects [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# absolute path - this won't work on someone else's computer
dat <- read.csv("/Users/meghajoshi/Desktop/R_course_2025/data/fifa_world_cup/women_wc/matches_1991_2023.csv")

# example of relative path
dat <- read.csv("data/fifa_world_cup_kaggle/women_wc/matches_1991_2023.csv")
```

## Basics of R: Objects and Assignment

```{r}
x <- 5
x
```

```{r}
y <- 2
x + y
```

```{r}
my_cats <- c("Moni", "Rumi")
my_cats
```

## R Packages

Please install the following packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse") # data wrangling and viz
install.packages("readxl") # read excel files
install.packages("janitor") # clean messy data
install.packages("estimatr") # robust estimators

```

# Coding Best Practices {.inverse}

## Write Clean Code

-   Write code that is easy to read

-   Add spaces between things

    ```{r}
    a<-c(1,2,3,4,5) # don't do this
    a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # do this
    ```

-   In R, please use `<-` to assign

    ```{r}
    x = 5 # don't do this
    x <- 5 # do this
    ```

-   Use `_` instead of `.` as separation when naming objects

    ```{r}
    my.color <- "blue" # don't do this
    my_color <- "blue" # do this
    ```

-   Some packages to help : [lintr](https://lintr.r-lib.org/)

## Write Good Documentation

-   Helps with reproducibility

-   For yourself and for other people who may use your code

-   Write comments

## Conduct Code Review

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
[![](images/code_check.png)](https://debruine.github.io/project/code-check/)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Process of systematically checking code

-   On your own or by someone else

-   Catch errors or suggest better ways to code

-   Check out the [Code Check Club](https://debruine.github.io/project/code-check/) by Lisa De Bruine et al.
